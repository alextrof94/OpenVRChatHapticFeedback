## About
App for haptic (vibration) notifications on new messages in twitch chat. 

It can "bz-bz bz-bz bz-bz" or "bz bz bzz" or "bzzzzz" on left controller, right or both.

You can setup for notifications only by *subscribers*, *moderators* or special "!hey" *command*.


Created by russian guy with twitch channel: *GoodVrGames*.

It's free. If you want to thank me, just say that you are using this application written by a simple russian guy if asked.

I understand english text, so you can also visit my channel and ask me anything.

Also you can customize haptic-template by changing "HapticAnimations.json" in folder with app.
